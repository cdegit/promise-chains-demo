# Promise Chains and Performance Demo

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

2. Start the server
```
npm start
```

3. Open a Guest window in Chrome. It's important to use Guest and not Incognito so that we don't have any browser extensions that could run JS on the page.

4. Go to localhost:3001

5. Open the Performance tab in Devtools and click the Start profiling and refresh page button

6. Uncomment the examples as you go!
